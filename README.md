## Abstract

*for JAPN 150: Advanced Japanese I.* Yale University stands as a world-renown institution. However, in contrast to institutions like Harvard and MIT, "Yale" remains relatively unfamiliar in Japan. We believe that there is an opportunity for Yale to expand its global presence in Japan. Thus, for our final presentation project, we propose the development of a comprehensive Yale Tour video accompanied by an informative website to enhance visibility and outreach in Japan.
